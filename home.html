	<p> Hi, welcome to my web page. If you didn't already know, my name is Vivian. Here, you'll learn different things about me (some that I didn't even realize existed until I made this) and my life experiences. 
	Hope you enjoy it! </p>
	<p>A short description of what each page will contain:</p>
	<h3>My Firsts </h3>
	<p>This page will list "My Firsts".</p>
	<h3>Trips/Vacations</h3>
	<p>This will talk about the places I’ve been to and my experiences there.</p>
	<h3>Hobbies</h3>
	<p>This is where I will list some of the hobbies I have picked up at one point (most that I’ve lost over time).</p>
	<h3>Citations</h3>
	<p>This will be where I cite my sources from the images I used to make sure credit is given to the creators of the images.</p>
