	<p class="hobbyP" style="float:right;"> The first hobby I’ve ever picked up was ballet. I started going to classes when I was around 4 years old, but not long after I quit (reason is unknown). 
	As of now, I wish my parents forced me to continue, but it’s too late for that. </p>

	<p class="hobbyP" style="float:right;">The second hobby I remember having was swimming. I had swimming lessons for a couple of years and I really enjoyed it. 
	It was especially fun because I was able to go swimming with my friends and to the beach without my parents worrying about my safety (drowning). Then, I stopped going to lessons (again, the reason is unknown).</p>

	<p class="hobbyP" style="float:right;">During the time I still had swimming lessons I started playing around with gymnastics with my friends. I think that started from watching youtube videos and then we decided we wanted to try it out. 
	Unlike the first two hobbies, I didn’t go to classes and it was just self taught (somehow I never got hurt). I haven’t really lost this hobby, but I have a lot less time to do it and it happened more when I was with my friends.</p>

	<p class="hobbyP" style="float:right;">The fourth hobby I’ve picked up is reading. I’ve always been a fast reader so I get through books fast, and for some reason it makes it more enjoyable. I guess it’s partially because I’m impatient and finishing a book gives me a satisfied feeling. 
	I also enjoy reading because I’m able to picture everything in my head and how each character is portrayed, unlike movies where basically everything about a character is given to you and you 
	aren’t able to see the character how you would like them to be.</p>

	<p class="hobbyP" style="float:right;">Another hobby I’ve picked up is drawing. I’ve been going to classes for a couple of years now and I still plan on continuing. Though I’m not a great artist, 
	it does help with projects that include art and is also a good way of spending time when you’re bored.</p>

	<p class="hobbyP" style="float:right;">The most recent hobby I’ve picked up is baking. Since there was the lockdown because of covid, I haven’t been able to go out and buy my weekly dose of sweets. So the way I decided to cope with that is by making them myself. 
	Not only do they taste good, they’re also healthier, and gives me a sense of accomplishment when I make something and it comes out good.</p>
